The project utilizes structured data to analyze spending patterns, highlight areas for improvement, and evaluate progress towards income targets.

## Key Features

Month-wise breakdown of expenses for a clear understanding of spending trends.

2. Payment Status Monitoring:

Tracks the status of bills (Paid vs. Unpaid) to help manage due dates effectively.

Includes due dates for timely reminders and improved financial discipline.

3. Income Goals and Progress Analysis:

Monthly income targets are outlined in a dedicated sheet.

Comparison of actual income vs. targets to assess financial goal achievement.

4. Data Visualization:

Key metrics and trends can be visualized using tools like Power BI for better understanding and decision-making.

Comprehensive Financial Overview:

Combines data on income and expenses to provide a holistic view of financial health.

## Tools Used

Power BI: Utilized for data visualization to create interactive dashboards, making complex financial data accessible and actionable.

Excel: Used for organizing and maintaining raw financial data with structured sheets for "Main Data" and "Income Goal."

## Key Insights

1. Expense Breakdown:

Housing expenses (e.g., Cleaning, Electric, Insurance) constitute a significant portion of monthly spending.

Consistent categorization helps identify recurring and controllable costs.

2. Payment Timeliness:

Majority of bills are paid on time; however, tracking "Unpaid" bills can prevent potential late fees.

Early payments in categories like "Electric" and "Water" improve creditworthiness.

3. Income Target Achievement:

Monthly income targets vary significantly, with peaks observed in months like March and February.

Comparing actual income with targets enables proactive adjustments to income streams or spending.

4. Budget Optimization Opportunities:

Identifying high-cost categories (e.g., Electric bills in January) provides opportunities for budget optimization.

Focus on reducing discretionary spending in non-essential sub-categories.

5. Trend Analysis:

Longitudinal data enables trend analysis, revealing seasonal or periodic changes in expenses and income.

Insights into peak spending periods aid in better financial planning for future months.
